# Adaptabrawl

Adaptabrawl is a 2D multiplayer fighting game that blends attack, defense, and evasion into a fast, legible combat loop.

Abstract: Matches evolve through adaptive conditions—stage/weather/match modifiers—and clear status effects such as poison, stagger/heavy‑attack windup, and low‑HP state. The experience prioritizes readability (icons, timers, telegraphs) and fairness.
