> Format required: “As a <role>, I want <goal> so that <benefit>.”

- As an online competitor, I want reliable 1v1 lobbies with predictable latency and easy rematch/reconnect, so that matches feel fair and I can keep playing without friction.
- As a player on mid-spec hardware, I want scalable VFX/performance presets, so that I can maintain frame rate.
- As a character explorer, I want fighters with clearly described playstyles (offense/defense/evasion) and difficulty tags, so that I can quickly pick a style that fits me.
- As a local 1v1 player, I want offline versus, so that we can play without internet or setup delays.
- As a character developer, I want a robust framework with documented character templates, so that I can add new/adjust fighters quickly.
- As a friend-match player, I want shareable room-code invites instead of account linking, so that we can play immediately, without an account or friends list.
