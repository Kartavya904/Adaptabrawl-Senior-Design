# Kartavya Singh

I’m Kartavya Singh, a Computer Science student at the University of Cincinnati who likes building useful, end-to-end software—especially where data, search, and clear UIs meet real people’s needs. Recent work spans production on multi-tenant SaaS architecture, an LLM-powered research explorer, hospital-facing dashboards, and applied ML analytics. I also stay sharp through hackathons—both product-innovation sprints that emphasize teamwork and user impact, and data/AI challenges that push analytics, modeling, and rapid experimentation. Outside of internships, I’ve supported peers as Supplement Review Session Leader & Math And Science Support tutor and led the Resident Advisor Role in residential life.

## Co-op and Other Related Experience:
### Data Engineering Intern (Full-Stack) — Possip | May 2025 - Aug 2025 | Nashville, TN (Remote)
- Built and optimized production features in a multi-tenant SaaS: Adaptive PDF exports (Prawn + Sidekiq jobs), WYSIWYG editor improvements, toast notifications, and a survey-builder revamp that streamlined admin workflows.
- Tech & practices: Ruby on Rails, React + TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Redis, Sidekiq, Devise, CarrierWave, Tailwind, Webpacker. Wrote tests in RSpec/Jest, followed RuboCop standards, and shipped via code reviews and CI.
- Takeaways: stronger systems thinking (background jobs, caching, permissions), pragmatic TDD, and reliability-first mindset.

### Computer Science Co-op — Live Well Collaborative | Jan 2025 – May 2025 | Cincinnati, OH
- Built a full-stack, LLM-powered research explorer used to search multi-year projects. Tech: Flask, React/Tailwind, AWS RDS (PostgreSQL).
- Co-created interactive AI personas for Procter & Gamble and mapped workflow automations for the Council on Aging.
- Skills used: API integration, authentication, data modeling, UI implementation; cross-functional collaboration and process mapping.

### Python/Flask Application Developer — iCDCU Lab | May 2023 – Aug 2023 | Cincinnati, OH
- Led ResDash webpages that improved experience for 700+ resident doctors; refactored code and introduced reusable components.
- Integrated D3, Flask Breadcrumbs, Bootstrap; measured ~45% efficiency improvement.
- Skills used: HTML/CSS/JS, Flask; teamwork, communication under tight timelines.

### Data Science Intern — Byte Link Systems | May 2022 – Jul 2022 | Houston, TX
- Built a Power BI dashboard analyzing global pneumonia trends; combined ML methods (e.g., logistic regression, gradient boosting, neural nets).
- Reported ~20% improvement in prediction accuracy; worked across Python/SQL/Tableau/PySpark.
- Skills used: data cleaning, modeling, visualization; presenting insights clearly.

## Project Sought (Capstone)
I’m looking for an applied, end-to-end capstone with a real stakeholder. Ideal themes:
- Search & knowledge tools (RAG/LLM-assisted retrieval over documents or research) with clear, explainable UI.
- Data-driven workflow apps (dashboards/automation that streamline operations in health, education, or civic settings).
- Full-stack delivery (auth, database, API, responsive frontend, observability, and helpful docs).

Preferred stacks include Python/Flask or Node with React/Tailwind and PostgreSQL, but I’m flexible if the problem is meaningful.
